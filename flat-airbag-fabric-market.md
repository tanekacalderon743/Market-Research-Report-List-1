<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Airbag Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flat Airbag Fabric Market is categorized into two primary types: coated and uncoated fabrics. Coated fabrics have a layer of protective material applied, enhancing durability, waterproofing, and resistance to abrasions and chemicals—ideal for high-performance applications. Uncoated fabrics, on the other hand, lack this additional layer, making them lighter and more breathable but potentially less resistant to environmental factors. Each type serves distinct applications based on performance requirements, cost considerations, and desired longevity in varying conditions.</p></p>
